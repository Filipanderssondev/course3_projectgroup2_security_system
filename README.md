### Project assignment:  
Develop a security alarm system that detects motion using an infrared sensor. The alarm system consists of the following components:   
* Infrared motion sensor - detects movement.  
* One buzzer - signals when motion is detected and when the alarm is activated.
* Pushbutton - resets the alarm.    
* LCD display - outputs the current alarm status (on/off/alarm triggered).
* RGB-LED - indicates system status: Green = alarm is off and red = alarm is on.

### Instructions:
1. Connect the hardware. (link connect.md)
2. Program using C/C++. (link placeholder.ino)
3. Create a circuit diagram. (link diagram.png)
4. Write a user manual. (link manual.md)

### Components: 
One Arduino Uno R4 Wifi or other compatible controller
One Breadboard 
One Peizo buzzer    
One LCD display
One HC-SR501 infrared sensor  
One Pushbutton  
One RGB-LED  

### Potential extensions (if time and resources are available):  

* Replace pushbuttons with a keypad for code entry.  
* Enable admin access to change the personal password.  
* Introduce the usage of a servo component.  
* Expand the alarm with diffrent sensors for example ultrasound or vibrationdetector.  

### Safety requirements:  
(To be defined based on project scope and implementation)
