_____________
### Overview:  
Develop a security alarm system that detects motion using an infrared sensor. The alarm system consists of the following components:   
* Infrared motion sensor - detects movement.
* One buzzer - signals when motion is detected and when the alarm is activated.
* Pushbutton - deactivates the alarm.    
* LCD display - outputs the current alarm status (on/off/alarm triggered).
* RGB-LED - indicates system status: Green = alarm is off and red = alarm is on.
_________

### Components (no extensions included): 
* One ***Arduino Uno R4 Wifi*** or other compatible controller  
* One ***breadboard***   
* One ***Peizo buzzer***      
* One ***LCD display***
* One ***HC-SR501*** infrared sensor  
* One ***pushbutton***  
* One ***RGB-LED***
____  

### Potential extensions (if time and resources are available):  

- [ ] Replace pushbuttons with a keypad for code entry.  
- [ ] Enable admin access to change the personal password.
- [ ] Introduce the usage of a servo component.
- [ ] Expand the alarm with diffrent sensors for example ultrasound or vibrationdetector.
