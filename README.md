### Project assignment:  
An alarm that uses an infrared sensor to discover movements. The alarm uses the following:   
An infrared motion sensor.  
Two summer to signal the alarm when motion is detected, alarm goes on/off, and a password is needed to shut of the alarm.    
An LCD display that outputs the state of the alarm(on/off), and if the password is denied or accepted.    
An RGB-LED that switches between green(when the alarm is off) and red(when the alarm is on).  
Four push buttons that is being used as password input.  

### Instructions:  

### Components: 
One Arduino Uno R4 Wifi or other compatible controller
One Breadboard 
One Peizo buzzer    
One LCD display  
One HC-SR501 infrared sensor  
Four Pushbuttons  
One RGB-LED  

### Potential extensions (if time and resources are available):  

Replace pushbuttons with combination component.  
Possibility as an admin to change the personal password.  
Introduce the usage of a servo component.  
Exapand the alarm with diffrent sensors for example ultrasound or vibrationdetector.  

### Safety requirements:
