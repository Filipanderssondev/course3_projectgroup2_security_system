### Project assignment:  
A security alarm that uses an infrared sensor to detect motion. The alarm uses the following components:   
* An infrared motion sensor.  
* Two buzzer to signal when motion is detected by PIR sensor, when the alarm is activated, a pushbutton resets the alarm.    
* An LCD display that outputs the current status of the alarm(on/off/alarm activated).
* An RGB-LED that switches between green(when the alarm is off) and red(when the alarm is on).

### Instructions:

### Components: 
One Arduino Uno R4 Wifi or other compatible controller
One Breadboard 
One Peizo buzzer    
One LCD display  
One HC-SR501 infrared sensor  
One Pushbutton  
One RGB-LED  

### Potential extensions (if time and resources are available):  

Replace pushbuttons with combination component.  
Possibility as an admin to change the personal password.  
Introduce the usage of a servo component.  
Exapand the alarm with diffrent sensors for example ultrasound or vibrationdetector.  

### Safety requirements:
